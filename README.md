# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, that's @Bolderaysky
## ðŸ‘€ About my interests
I'm Python/C++ desktop developer. In the past, I was also developing software for microcontrollers and mobile platforms.
## What I'm currently doing
I'm currently developing few C++ projects, including [overload.js](https://github.com/cjnix35/overload-js). There's my plan to the near future:
+ Learn how to use full power of STL C++.
+ Learn how graphics is designed and working.
## Why I've chosen exactly Python && C++ programming languages
I wanted to learn two or more programming languages, one of which should be a scripting language. For this reason, I began to learn Python, because that's a simple programming language with understandable syntax. My second main language is C++, I chose it for those reasons:
+ It's precisely that one programming language, with which you can write anything you want.
+ If you've learned C++, you won't have troubles with any other programming language.
+ That's just challenge for me :)
